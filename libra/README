This example is using the following toolchain:

- Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers 3.7.1 (Indigo SR1)
- OSGi Bundle Facet 0.1.1 (part of Indigo release)
- JRebel (optional)
- Gemini Web 2.0.1 

See for details platform/eclipse-platform.p2f 

Beginner hint: you can use File > Import > Install > Install software items from file wizard 
In this case it's recommended to download Indigo SR1 JEE edition and start from there.

If you happen to have JRebel license around you can play around with it.
rebel.xml files and provided launch configration are tweaked to compensate for workspace 
location in the filesystem, but they make an assumption that the git repo will be cloned 
to a directory named 'enterprise-osgi-examples' inside the workspace directory.

After cloning the repository use Import projects > Import existing projects on /libra subfolder, select all three.

After the import you need to switch to correct target platform to clear the build errors:
Window > Preferences > Plug-in development > Target platform, Select gemini-web-2.0.1
Restetting the platform will cause download of a pile of bundles from the network.

When done, open Run Configrations dialog and find equinox-gemini-web under OSGi Framework category. 

Launch it and open http://localhost:8080/libra in the browser.

If you have JRebel try editing the html file and java sources. Changes should be visible at next page refresh.
